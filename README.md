## Hello!
##### This is the comprehensive repository for my 2018/2019 AQA A-Level Computer Science Non-Exam Assessment

Here is the class diagram of the program:

Here is the program flow:

[Here is a video](https://youtu.be/txjnF8Z7a0o) showcasing the program in action

To build and run this:
- You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm as a prerequisite
- Clone this repository
- Open your favourite CLI in the repository folder (Git Bash is my choice)
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test`
- Optionally (more like mandatory), provide your own Google Maps API key, which you can obtain from [their website](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) (and make sure you enable the Places API and digital signing)
- Save your key in the "Settings" section of the "Configure game" page
- You're now free to host/connect to worlds and mess around

A few footnotes here:
- I'm developing and testing this on Windows 10 x64, so I cannot guarantee that other operating systems will work.
- This is a pretty barebones proof-of-concept, and so it will not get in-depth in terms of gameplay (seriously, don't expect too much fun from this, most of the fun was sourced from making this program in the first place)
- If there's any issues you somehow encounter, report it here.
